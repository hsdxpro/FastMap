# FastMap (associative container)

My goal is to make the fastest Map::Find(key) solution possible

Important notes:
 - Not final product, Find, Insert, Erase will be improved as soon as possible
 - Keys larger than 64 bit are NOT SUPPORTED yet
 - Memory buffer cannot grow when Inserting, so construct FastMap with desired capacity needed

Current Properties:
 - Finding keys that has a low chance to occur in the Map (SUPER FAST)
 - Finding keys that has a high chance to occur in the Map (FAST)
 - Erase not implemented yet
 - Insert really slow, will be improved soon
